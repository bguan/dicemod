# Dicemod

A simple Minecraft Mod adding a Dice as a new Block.

Based on Example 1 of [GreyGhost](https://github.com/TheGreyGhost)'s excellent [MineCraftByExample](https://github.com/TheGreyGhost/MinecraftByExample) project.

This mod adds a Dice as a custom block to Minecraft.

When you first placed it down, it will randomly choose a face as up.  Like a crafting table you can put it down and take it back.
